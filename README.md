# TheSocialApp
Tired of feeling alone or not being able to find parties? Well, TheSocialApp is your solution! TheSocialApp is an Android mobile application which allows you to create and join social events or gatherings in a few button taps. All events are geo-located by default, meaning you will never have to go far to find an event using the app. The two central components of TheSocialApp are the events feed, which lists out the events and their details, and a maps view that shows all events close to you. With TheSocialApp, we aim to make sure that you never miss a killer party or an awesome sports tournament ever again.
